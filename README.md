# Continued-Fractions-and-Quadratic-Forms-A-Novel-Factorization-Method
In this repository, I publish the code of the factorization algorithm designed in my master thesis. 
This algorithm leverage the properties of continued fractions and quadratic forms.
It has as starting point recent works of Michele Elia, who revisited the fundamental concepts of SQUFOF, including reduced quadratic forms, distance between quadratic forms, and Gauss composition.
## Input
This algorithm takes two inputs:
